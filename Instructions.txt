The filters work using the following flags:
-s followed by a username will filter messages by that username
-k followed by a keyword will filter messages by that keyword
-b followed by a list of words will filter using these words as a blacklist. e.g. -b  [ exampleword1, exampleword2, exampleword3 ]
-n will censor all phone and bank card numbers from the messages
-i will censor all sender ids from the messages
